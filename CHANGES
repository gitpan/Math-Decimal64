0.04
 - Fix bugs in t/lengthy_mantissa.t. (A '-' in a regex needed to be escaped.)
   Also the precise number that appears in $@ for test 3 will vary, depending
   upon nvsize. (Test 3 modified to accommodate this.)

0.03
 - Add LDtoD64 and D64toLD (conversions between Math::LongDouble and
   Math::Decimal64 objects).

0.02
 - Small change to _sci2me() to avoid 'uninitialized' warnings on 5.10 (and
   perhaps earlier).

   Replace 'exp10' (which already exists in at least some C libraries)
   with Exp10.

0.01
 - First release.
